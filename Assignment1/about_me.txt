Hello,

My name is Branden Lopez, my student ID is 015359227, and my email is: branden.lopez@sjsu.edu 
I am a first year graduate student majoring in Data Science. I attained my Bachelor's degree in Financial Mathematics and Statistics 
from the University of California Santa Barbara. While I have taken no prior SJSU CS courses, 
I have taken CS courses at my local community college and covered many CS topics during my undergrad. 
While there are no special topics I would like to cover during the duration of this course, I look forward to challenging myself and improving my skills.
