The Integer class wraps a value of the primitive type int in an object(instance).
An object of type Integer contains a single field whose type is int. 

The advantage of using the class Integer is that many methods are present to easily convert an integer to a 
string or a string to an integer. Other than methods for stings, we can find information about the primative datatype
int in the IntegerClass.

Depite the Integer class having many useful methods since it is an instance, using the Integer class creates
object references for the saved "Integer". 
That is:
	Integer X=5;
	Integer Y=X;
	Y = 0;
Produces:
	X=0
This is because when Y=X, we copy the reference and when Y=0 we change the object which the that reference points at.

Due to the integer class referencing heap memory, it is slower that the primative type int when being called.
